# Simple Notes
A minimalist note taking Android app with the option to encrypt notes, export notes to a text file.  
The notes [are stored](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/more/limitations) in the User's app directory: `Android/data/com.nav.notes.simple_notes/files/`, rather than in the cache. This means that if you uninstall the app or go to Android's `Settings > Apps > simple_notes > Storage` and choose `Clear Data`, the notes in the app will disappear and the `.txt` files in the User's app directory will also disappear.   
In the app's Settings page even if you specify a folder to export to, if the app is unable to export to that folder, it will use the `Android/data/com.nav.notes.simple_notes/files/` folder as a fallback.  
It is advisable to manually backup the files periodically.
