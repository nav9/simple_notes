# Simple Notes
A minimalist note taking Android app with the option to export notes to a text file.  
The notes [are stored](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/more/limitations) in the User's app directory: `Android/data/com.nav.notes.simple_notes/files/`, rather than in the cache. This means that if you uninstall the app or go to Android's `Settings > Apps > simple_notes > Storage` and choose `Clear Data`, the notes in the app will disappear and the `.txt` files in the User's app directory will also disappear.   
When notes are exported as a text file, they are stored in the User's app directory as `.txt` files with a unique timestamp of the time it was saved at. Having multiple such versions offers a good backup.   
It is advisable to manually backup and/or delete the files periodically.  

# Download and install
The `.apk` file is available in the `./Download/` folder of this repository. You can copy the file into your phone and select it to install it. You may have to go to your phone's settings and enable the option to install from unknown sources. The other option is to clone this repository to your computer, install Flutter and Dart and build this project to generate your own `.apk` file.

# TODO
* An option for the User to specify the folder to save files to.  
* An option or menu on the home-screen to delete all old `.txt` files and/or to back them up by zipping them and saving them to a User-specified folder.
